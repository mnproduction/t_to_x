# Refactoring `apps/interface.py` and the `core` Directory

## Overview

The current codebase utilizes a series of abstract classes and interfaces within `apps/interface.py` and the `core` directory to manage message reception, content publishing, message processing, and application management. While abstraction is beneficial for scalability and flexibility, in this context—where the primary functionality is to send a "+" message to a Telegram group upon receiving a media group—it introduces unnecessary complexity.

This refactoring aims to **simplify the codebase** by removing redundant abstractions, streamlining the architecture, and enhancing maintainability without compromising functionality.

## Current Structure

### `apps/interface.py`

## Refactoring Strategy

1. **Remove Unnecessary Abstractions**: 
   - Given the simplicity of the application's functionality, abstract classes for message reception, content publishing, and message processing are unnecessary.
   
2. **Consolidate Functionality**:
   - Merge the responsibilities of message reception and content publishing directly within the Telegram client or dedicated handler classes.
   
3. **Eliminate the `core` Directory**:
   - With the removal of abstract classes and managers, the `core` directory becomes redundant and can be safely removed.

4. **Simplify Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Integrate logging directly where needed without intermediary managers or processors.

## Refactored Code

### 1. Remove `apps/interface.py`

Since the abstract classes are no longer needed, delete the `apps/interface.py` file.
